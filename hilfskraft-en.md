[**ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª GERMAN VERSION**](/hilfskraft)

_The project Opening Reproducible Research (o2r) is looking for student assitants to join our team._

o2r is a research project funded by the DFG and is conducted jointly by the Spatio-Temporal Modelling Lab (Prof. Pebesma), the Situated Computing Lab (Prof. Kray), and the University and State Library of MÃ¼nster (ULB).
We work on new ways to preserve geoscientific research by improving computational reproducibility and interaction with scientific articles. 
Â 
The o2r team develops new tools as free and open source software on GitHub and uses current technologies, such as JavaScript/Node.js or containerisation with Docker.
Your tasks will be implementation and extension of software for reproducible geosciences.
The weekly flexible work time is 9 to 19 hours.

**Profile**

You should have some programming experience (e.g., JavaScript, R, Python, or another object oriented language) and must be motivated to extend your skills as a software developer in an agile scientific environment.
You can conduct your work independently and communicate complex topics in English (spoken and written).
Knowledge of Linux, Docker or user interface development with JavaScript (React) are useful but not required.

_Interested?_ Send us a short e-mail about you including references to prior programming experiences (e.g., links to GitHub projects) to the address stated below.
If you have questions feel free to get in touch personally!

TheÂ  University of MÃ¼nster advocates gender justice and wants to increase the proportion of women in research.
We strongly encourage applications from qualified women.
Female applicants will be given preferential consideration when their level of qualification, competence, and professional achievements equals that of male candidates, unless arguments based on the personal background of a male co-applicant prevail.

*We look forward to hearing from you!*
