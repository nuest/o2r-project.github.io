As everyone is slowly coming back to work, the o2r team wishes _Happy New Year_. What better way to start the year with planning some fun trips? Here are our recommendations for upcoming events:

- [EGU sessions on Reproducible Research, R, and FOSS](/2018/01/05/announcements-2018/#open-science-r-and-foss-sessions-at-egu-general-assembly-2018)
- [EGU short course "Writing reproducible geoscience papers"](/2018/01/05/announcements-2018/#short-course-on-reproducible-papers-at-egu-general-assembly-2018)
- [AGILE pre-conference workshop "Reproducible Research Publications"](/2018/01/05/announcements-2018/#reproducible-research-publications-at-agile-2018)

## Open Science, R, and FOSS sessions at EGU General Assembly 2018

The European Geophysical Union's General Assembly (EGU GA) takes place once more in April in Vienna - [#EGU18](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23egu18).
The deadline for abstracts is 10 Jan 2018, 13:00 CET, so don't delay, **[submit your abstract today](https://egu2018.eu/information/deadlines_and_milestones.html)** to one of the following sessions:

- [Open Data, Reproducible Research, and Open Science](http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2018/session/28036) (ESSI3.5)
- [Râ€™s deliberate role in Earth sciences (PICO Session)](http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2018/session/27584) (IE4.4/GM2.8/AS5.8/BG1.17/CL5.28/GD10.10/GMPV10.5/HS3.5/SSS13.77/TS11.12)
- [Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) for Geoinformatics and Geosciences](http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2018/session/26511) (PICO Session, ESSI3.1)

Other sessions without o2r team members convening, but looking very interesting are

- [Leveraging data-driven workflows to accelerate Earth Science research](http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2018/session/28043) (ESSI3.3)
- [Data science, Analytics and Visualization: The challenges and opportunities for Earth and Space Science](http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2018/session/28030) (ESSI4.3)
- [Future of (hydrological) publishing (PICO session)](http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2018/session/26942) (HS1.16)
- [Web-based Exchange and Processing of Environmental Data](http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2018/session/28034) (ESSI2.6)

After our [previous](/2016/05/02/egu-review/) [participations](/2017/05/04/o2r-at-EGU/) we look forward to yet another event with interesting presentations and great conversations. _See you at EGU!_

## Short course on reproducible papers at EGU General Assembly 2018

After our [last years workshop on reproducible computational research in the publication cycle](/2017/05/03/egu-short-course-recap/), o2r is teaming up again with [ReproZip](https://reprozip.org/) to help geoscientists tackling the challenges of reproducible papers.
This year we organise the short course [_SC1.13 - Writing reproducible geoscience papers using R Markdown, Docker, and GitLab_](http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2018/session/28650).
We plan to go guide participants through the steps of writing an open publication (????is it clear what that is????) with literate programming and managing its rendering, publication, and archival by using free online platforms.

Let us know you're interested to join with only two clicks: **[https://doodle.com/poll/ngn9fqvhfkp3haui](https://doodle.com/poll/ngn9fqvhfkp3haui)**

Other short courses without o2r participation, but looking promising (they both use **R**!), are

- SC1.34 - [Improving statistical evaluations in the geosciences](http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2018/session/29054)
- SC1.17 - [Using R for natural hazard risk modelling, with applications to wildfire risk forecasting](http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2018/session/28648)

## Reproducible Research Publications at AGILE 2018

We are happy to announce another [continuation](/2017/05/10/o2r-at-AGILE/), a pre-conference workshop at the [21st AGILE International Conference on Geographic Information Science](http://agile-online.org/index.php/conference/conference-2018) in Lund, Sweden: **["Reproducible Research Publications"](http://o2r.info/reproducible-agile/)**

> The half day workshop attempts to provides a hands-on introduction to reproducible research by reproducing a provided real-world publication. Together with the instructors they create a reproducible document from text, code, and data of a scholarly publication and publish it in a data repository.

The workshop is accepted and will be announced [on the conference website](https://agile-online.org/index.php/programme-2018/agile-workshops-2018) soon.
Please also check the [workshop website](http://o2r.info/reproducible-agile/) for detailed information on registration and scheduling.
