We are excited to share the latest conference presentations of past O2R team members! Even though the project now delivered, the dedication of the people who were instrumental in our now-delivered project still contributes to the field.

On September 6th, Edzer Pebesma presented his work [_Reproducing Spatial Data Science Publications_](https://doi.org/10.25436/E23K5H) at the [4th Spatial Data Science Symposium](http://sdss2023.spatial-data-science.net/), where he discusses the challenges posed by the always evolving  software, the several dependencies and the publishing industry, reports on experiences from developer communities, and looks at the convergence in the spatial data science software ecosystems.

On September 13th, I presented the exploratory study that we elaborated with Christian Kray about [_Map Reproducibility in Geoscientific Publications_](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2023/18901/pdf/LIPIcs-GIScience-2023-6.pdf) at the 12th  International Conference on Geographic Information Science (GIScience 2023), where we suggest an inceptive set of criteria to assess the success of map reproduction and a set of guidelines for improving map reproducibility in geoscientific publications. 

If you want to help us understand better the notion of map reproducibility by sharing your POV, take part in the survey that is already up and running: [https://t.ly/qquoj](https://t.ly/qquoj).
